                Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar BR pronounced born 24 April 1973 is an
                Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian
                national team. He is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in
                the history of cricket.[4]<br />
                He is the all-time highest run-scorer in both ODI and Test
                cricket with more than 18,000 runs and 15,000 runs,
                respectively.[5] He also holds the record for receiving the most
                man-of-the-match awards in international cricket.[6] Tendulkar
                took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test match debut
                on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of
                sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India
                internationally for over 24 years.[7] In 2002, halfway through
                his career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman
                of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI
                batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[8] <br />Later in his
                career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team that won the 2011
                Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances
                for India.[9] <br />He had previously been named "Player of the
                Tournament" at the 2003 World Cup. Tendulkar has received
                several awards from the government of India: the Arjuna Award
                (1994), the Khel Ratna Award (1997), the Padma Shri (1998), and
                the Padma Vibhushan (2008).<br />
                After Tendulkar played his last match in November 2013, the
                Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the
                Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[12][13] He was the
                first sportsperson to receive the reward, and as of 2021, he is
                the youngest recipient and was the first sportsperson to receive
                the award.[14][15] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya
                Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.[16] In 2010,
                Time included Tendulkar in its annual list of the most
                influential people in the world.<br />
                Tendulkar was awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for
                cricketer of the year at the 2010 International Cricket Council
                (ICC) Awards.[18] Having retired from ODI cricket in
                2012,[19][20] he retired from all forms of cricket in November
                2013 after playing his 200th Test match.[21]<br />
                Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total,
                scoring 34,357 runs.[22] In 2013, Tendulkar was included in an
                all-time Test World XI to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden
                Cricketers' Almanack, and he was the only specialist batsman of
                the postâ€“World War II era, along with Viv Richards, to get
                featured in the team.[23]<br />
                In 2019, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[24]
